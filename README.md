# NFT-Project

Welcome to the NFT-Project! I've expanded the existing NFT contract by introducing a new function called `borrowAuthNFT`. This function makes it possible for others to access our NFT's metadata.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/)
- Cadence Language

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to make use of this project:

1. Visit the [Flow Playground](https://play.flow.com/) and create your own Contracts, Transactions, and Scripts files.

2. Execute the `CreateCollection` transaction to establish your NFT collection.

3. Run the `MintNFT` transaction to mint a new NFT.

4. Execute the `GetID` script to obtain the NFT ID required for the main script.

5. Utilize the `MetaData` script to access and retrieve data from the NFT you've created.
